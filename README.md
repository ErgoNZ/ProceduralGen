# ProceduralGen
This repository is mainly just for my prefab procedural generation experiments.
# Current Versions
## World Generation.cs  
Has impossible spawns for rooms that can never be reached
## RoomGeneration.cs 
Doesn't give all of the rooms that were requested (Request 50 rooms but only get 35 instead)
